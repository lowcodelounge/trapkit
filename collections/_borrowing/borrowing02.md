title: Does NARA lend original documents for exhibition use?
---

Yes, original documents or artifacts may be loaned to qualified institutions for exhibition when the purpose of the loan is to inform and educate the public about NARA, its holdings, or the national experience while ensuring their continued availability for the future. Exhibitions must be accessible to the public and may not be primarily political or commercial.

Borrowers should submit a written request 180 days prior to the loan date and include an [American Alliance of Museums](http://www.aam-us.org/) or equivalent. NARA's security, fire protection, environmental, and transport requirements are intended to preserve and protect NARA's holdings and borrowers are expected to comply with them.
