## Contributing to the code

### Principles

This is a first draft of some principles to help differentiate this project:

- **Simple, robust, open-source tech stack**: This project useses Markdown, USWDS, and GitHub Pages because they work well for a variety of use cases and they're not too complicated. (It also uses a smidgen of jQuery.)

- **High content-to-character-count ratio**: HTML is tucked away in templates and compiled CSS is available through design tokens and utility classes so builders can focus on the content and see everything that will be on the page in one place.

- **Flexibility without complexity**: This project offers a selection of common pre-built components, layout, and templates focused on broad usability without an overwhemling number of choices and configurations.

- **As little JavaScript as possible**: Add to the web's default interactivity only when necessary and prioritize simplicity and ease of use over best coding practices.

- **A prototype, not a promise**: The intent is to build something to validate a hypothesis, not to put into production.

- **Accessibility always**: Think about this and test for it at the beginning so it's not forgotten at the end.
