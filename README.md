# Make rapid web prototypes ‚Äî responsive as code, easy as paper ‚Äî and get real feedback real fast.

Use this template to build working prototypes in the browser with the human-friendliest tech stack around: [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) for content, [USWDS](https://designsystem.digital.gov/) for components, and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) for hosting. All free and open-source.

## üèó How it works

This repository template provides everything you need to get started with rapid web prototyping. These are the high-level steps:

1. Create content and link it together with [GitHub-flavored Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/).
1. Add [USWDS components](https://designsystem.digital.gov/components/overview/) to your pages with a line or two of text.
1. Go live with GitHub Pages and get feedback.

### üï∫ Get down with Markdown and go content-first
The most important thing people interact with on your page is the content. This is why they're there ‚Äî either to get information or get something done. So let go of lorem ipsum and start testing your content first. Markdown makes it easy to format your text without messy HTML tags.

### üëã Goodbye hotspot. Hello hyperlink.
Hotspot-based prototype tools are nice, but there's nothing like interacting with a real website on a real device for seeing how users actually respond to your hypothesis. And as easy as it is to build in the browser, you'll spend less time futzing around in Figma and more time validating your ideas.

### ‚ôº Stop annotating and start iterating.
Working with an accessibility-aware, mobile-friendly design system allows you to focus more on collaboration with developers and less on communicating design details. The U.S. Web Design System includes a robust set of well-documented components that work out of the box. Even if you're already using a design system, this approach covers the basics so you can concentrate on what makes your design unique.
