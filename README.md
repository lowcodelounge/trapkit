# Trap Kit | The no-cost, no-catch rapid web prototyping toolkit for no-coders to get real feedback real fast.

**Trap Kit** is a ‚Äúfauxcode‚Äù toolkit of components, layouts, and templates to build working prototypes in the browser using the human-friendliest tech stack around: [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) for content, [USWDS](https://designsystem.digital.gov/) for components, and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) for hosting. All free and open-source.

**Visit the public-facing site at [trapkit.co](https://trapkit.co).**

## üèó How it works

This repository template provides everything you need to get started with rapid web prototyping. These are the high-level steps:

1. Create content and link it together with [GitHub-flavored Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/).
1. Add [USWDS components](https://designsystem.digital.gov/components/overview/) to your pages with a line or two of text.
1. Go live with GitHub Pages and get feedback.
